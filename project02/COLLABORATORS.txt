Time: 25 hours? Not really sure, and a lot of that was spent waiting for models
to run.

Resources: I used a lot of sklearn documentation and some code tutorial
websites when I ran into syntax bugs. I also really appreciated Professor
Allen's lectures and code demos, they provided a lot of good advice for this
project. Additionally, other student's questions on Piazza provided a lot
of insight into things I should be looking out for.
