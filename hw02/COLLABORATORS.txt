Help:
        I went to Professor Allen's office hours, where he answered all my 
    questions and helped me figure out a logic error in my code. Most of the
    time I spent was figuring out Python, not really conceptual gaps. I also 
    looked at the code demo for polynomial regression and at the documentation
    for ridge regression.
