Help:
    For help, I looked at Prof. Allen's code demos and lecture notes. These 
    were super helpful for conceptual understanding. I also looked at other
    students' questions on Piazza, which were super helpful.

    While I feel like I was able to play around with hyperparameters and 
    different feature transformations, it took such a long time to actually
    get results -- training one group of models would sometimes take 10 minutes
    or more, and that really slowed me down.
