    "## Part 1: Logistic Regression for Digit Classification\n",
    "The goal of this part is to train a logistic regression model that can take in 28x28 pixel greyscale images of handwritten 8s and 9s, and identiies each image as an 8 or a 9. A logistic regression model is trained on the given train data-digits_8_vs_9_noisy dataset. Several model hyperparameters were altered and used to generate different models in order to find a model that correctly classifies the training data."
