Time: 5 hours

Resources:
I used the linked sklearn documentation, Professor Allen's code demos and 
lectures, the readings from the decision tree week, and other students' 
questions and responses on Piazza.

Difficulties:
It took me a while to actually figure out how to code the entrpies and 
probabilites, and to extend what we had covered in lecture to 3-class data.
