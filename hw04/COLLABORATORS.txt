Time: 4 hours

Resources:
    I went to Professor Allen's office hours to ask about the underlying
    differences between the models, I looked at other students' questions
    on Piazza. I also looked at Prof. Allen's code demos and lecture notes.

Help:
    I mostly had to wrap my head around the calculations and weight
    adjustments for the solvers and activation functions.
