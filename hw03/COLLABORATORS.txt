   Total: 10 hours

Help:
      While I didn't go to office hours specifically for this assignment, I recieved 
   help by attending Professor Allen's live sessions and looking at other students' Piazza
   questions.

Confusion:
      I used the documentation for Perceptrons, Classifier CVs, ROC, and AUC for ROC, and
   I had to look up some pandas functions and some Python syntax stuff. I had some trouble
   figuring out some plotting stuff, but I think I got it in the end.
